## Synopsis

Escher is an OCaml library which defines a parametric GADT describing the
shape of the type occurring in the parameter.  Its values can drive the
automatic construction of generic algorithms at runtime, similar to to how
`ppx_deriving` can generate algorithms over types at compile-time.
